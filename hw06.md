### 5、使用维基百科，解释以下概念：

#### CPU

A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. The computer industry has used the term "central processing unit" at least since the early 1960s. Traditionally, the term "CPU" refers to a processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry.<br/>

#### RAM

Random-access memory (RAM) is a form of computer data storage that stores data and machine code currently being used. A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory. In contrast, with other direct-access data storage media such as hard disks, CD-RWs, DVD-RWs and the older magnetic tapes and drum memory, the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement.<br/>

#### ROM

Read-only memory (ROM) is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers and other electronic devices. Data stored in ROM can only be modified slowly, with difficulty, or not at all, so it is mainly used to store firmware (software that is closely tied to specific hardware, and unlikely to need frequent updates) or application software in plug-in cartridges.<br/>

#### Bus (computing)

In computer architecture, a bus (a contraction of the Latin omnibus) is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers. This expression covers all related hardware components (wire, optical fiber, etc.) and software, including communication protocols.<br/>

#### Parallel computing

Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has long been employed in high-performance computing, but it's gaining broader interest due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling. As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years, parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors.<br/>

### 6、写一段文字，简单解释“云计算（cloud computing）”

云计算是一种按使用量付费的模式，这种模式提供可用的、便捷的、按需的网络访问， 进入可配置的计算资源共享池（资源包括网络，服务器，存储，应用软件，服务），这些资源能够被快速提供，只需投入很少的管理工作，或与服务供应商进行很少的交互。<br/>

### 7、小孙买了计算机主板，说明书表明“支持双通道DDR3-1333内存，最大支持16G”

1）DDR3内存，“3”和“1333”的含义是什么？<br/>
“3”指第三代内存；“1333”指内存频率为1333Mhz。<br/>

2）小孙买8G DDR3-1600的内存能提高性能吗？<br/>
不能，由于主板不支持，8G DDR3-1600的内存条会被识别成8G DDR3-1333，不能提高性能。<br/>

3）小孙买4G*2 DDR3-1333的内存能提高性能吗？<br/>
能，4G*2 DDR3-1333的内存能通过提高存取速度而提高性能。<br/>

4）16G需要多少位地址？<br/>
34位。<br/>

### 备注，维基百科（中文）“DDR3 SDRAM”

#### DDR3 SDRAM

第三代双倍数据率同步动态随机存取存储器（Double-Data-Rate Three Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory，一般称为DDR3 SDRAM），是一种计算机存储器规格。它属于SDRAM家族的存储器产品，提供相较于DDR2 SDRAM更高的运行性能与更低的电压，是DDR2 SDRAM（四倍数据率同步动态随机存取存储器）的后继者（增加至八倍）。
